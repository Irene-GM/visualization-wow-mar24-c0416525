### Data analysis with WOW observations using virtual research environments

With the rise of cloud technologies an increasing number of datasets are becoming available in remote machines. It is the case of contemporary crowdsourced weather datasets, which are typically created in cloud-based infrastructures. In this context, virtual research environments (VRE) seem to be a good complement to carry out data analysis using crowdsourced weather observations. At KNMI, we are experimenting how VREs can enable new analyses with WOW data that can also be shared with other users working in the same area. 

In this snapshot, we share four of these jupyter notebooks that hopefully will be encouraging to pursuit these early coupling of crowdsourced weather datasets with a cloud-based "data analysis space", in which only the skills and the willingness of the users (along with data availability :-) ) are the limiting factors.

Here a brief description of each of the notebooks:

- `visualize-wownl-coverage.ipynb`: Simple notebook counting the number of WOW-NL observations per grid cell in a month.
- `visualize-wownl-netatmo.ipynb`: Plots the two networks at 1km of spatial resolution
- `visualize-wownl-temp-outliers.ipynb`: Visualization showing quality flags of every WOW station in three provinces in 15-min slots
- `visualize-wownl-temp-quality.ipynb`: Simple dashboard showing different aspects of quality

The snapshot exports the graphical output of each of the notebooks, but to run them, they require sample data.
